This brief summary of the [DFG GSP codex](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/grundlagen_rahmenbedingungen/gwp/kodex/index.html)([pdf](https://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/foerderung/rechtliche_rahmenbedingungen/gute_wissenschaftliche_praxis/kodex_gwp.pdf)) is by Stephan Janosch, [MPI-CBG](http://www.mpi-cbg.de), https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2401-6862.

It focuses on research software and data.

**Remark:** This document is not an official translation.


## 3.2 general principles

### guideline 1: commiting to the principles

Institutions define with their members rules of GSP[^1], make them public and commit to these rules.

### guideline 2: profession ethos

Scientists are responsible to stand in for values. Dissemination starts as early as possible. Further education happens regularly.

### guideline 3: responsibility of head staff

Head staff creates proper prevailing conditions. It's responsible for staying on course and dissemination of GSP. 

### guideline 4: responsibility of unit heads

Units must be able to collaborate and coordinate and each member must know its role and duties. Caring for newbies and facilitation of career building happens for scientists and other staff (e.g. technicians).

### guideline 5: performance dimensions and evaluation criteria

Other aspects than scientific performance can be taken into account.

### guideline 6: ombudsmen

There is at least one. Deputy should be present. They need to be known.

## 3.3 research process

### guideline 7: phase-spanning QA

If results are made public, the mechanisms of QA have to be indicated.

**Explanation:**

Alignment with discipline specific standards and methods in regards to

- device calibration
- measurements
- processing and analysis of data
- *selection and usage of research software*
- *development of research software*
- usage of ELNs[^2]

Source of data, organisms, materials and *software* is stated and reuse is documented. Citation happens. Created data is described. *software source code must be made persistent and citable, as well as documented*.

### guideline 8: persons involved, responsibilities and roles

Responsibilities and roles have to be clear any time.

### guideline 9: research planing (design)

State of the art is considered at planing. Careful investigations about public resources are being made. Institutions provide support.

### guideline 10: legal and ethical framework and usage rights

Scientist take rights and duties into account. Documented usage rights of research results are part of the framework.

**Explanation:**
As early as possible it will be decided upon usage permissions and these will be documented.

### guideline 11: methods and standards

Scientists use reproducible methods. Newly created methods require strict QA and new standards.

**Explanation:**

Standards help to reuse *software*, collection information and result description. This is necessary for comparability and transferability of results.

### guideline 12: documentation

Documentation is needed for correctness checking and evaluation. Discipline specific recommendations have to be taken into account.

**Explanation:**

For replication all needed information must present, including:
(re-)used data, methods, analysis steps. Citations should be plausible. If possible, third parties should have access to these information. Source code is to be documented.

### guideline 13: open access
Results have to be described completely and comprehensivly. If possible,  all used data, materials, methods and *software* have to be made available and workflows describe their interplay. Self created *research software* must be made available including source code.

**Explanation:**

Archives and repositories will be used according the FAIR principles. *Software has to have an appropriate license.*

### guideline 14: authorship

Everybody who genuinly contributed to text, data or software is author. Authors check, that results will be made citable by publishers or infrastructure providers.

### guideline 15: publication location/agency

Scientists select publication locations carefully. Review happens.

**Explanation:**

Next to books and journals, there exist also discipline specific repos, data- and software repos.

### guideline 16: confidentiality and neutrality at evaluations

...

### guideline 17: archival

public made data, raw data and software are to be kept. Infrastructure has to be provided.

**Explanation:**

By default a time period of 10 years applies.
